Built to provide geo-spatial agricultural services for farmers.
Therefore, by using cloud technologies, it's currently designed to provide fertilizer recommendations, climate, and satellite images to farms and plots across Brazil's territory. Currently, the delivery of the service is through WhatsApp, where farmers can enjoy fast and reliable service deliver.

It's powered by FastAPI and AWS.
